### Description

This a robust algorithm and introduces the idea of mutating individuals based on 3 others, in order to work as a gravitational force into the minimums.

### Types of problems

This algorithm solves continuous multidimensional optimization problems.

### Representation

A vector of real values.

$$\vec{x^{i}} = < x_{1}^{i}, x_{2}^{i},...,x_{d}^{i} >$$

### Mutation

This is the main operation of differential evolution.

For each individual $x^i$, another one called $v^i$ is generated by performing the following operation.

$$v^i = x^{r1} + (x^{r2} - x^{r3})F$$

$$0 \leq F \leq 2$$

### Crossover/Recombination 

A new individual is created element by element, randomly picking values from the original one $x^i$ or the mutated one $v^i$.

This is performed based on a Crossover probability $0 \leq Cr \leq 1$.

$$u^i_k = v^i_k \quad if \quad rand(0, 1) \leq Cr \quad else \quad x^i_k$$

### Survivor selection

Tournament is used: The best individual between $u^i$ and $x^i$ is selected to be part of the next generation.

### Pseudocode

<p align = "center">Differential evolution</p>

```
Parameters: 
    N -> Population size
    G -> Maximum number of generations
    Cr -> Crossover probability

Return: the best individual

Begin 
    Create the initial population of N individuals
    Calculate the population fitness
    While the number of generations is less than G or a good solution hasn't been found
        For each individual in the population.
            Mutation -> Create new individual
            Crossover -> Combine the individuals
            Calculate the fitness of the new one
            Selection -> Select the best between both
        End for
    End while
End
```
