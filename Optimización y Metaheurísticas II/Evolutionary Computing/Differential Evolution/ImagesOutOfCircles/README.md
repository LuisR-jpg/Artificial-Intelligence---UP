    Starry Night. Comparison of the original and result.

## What is this project about?

Given an image, this project tries to make a similar one by drawing a bunch of circles. For each circle the algorithm has to calculate the optimal values of the folllowing features.

- Coordinates of the center.

- Radius.

- RGBA. Where A represents the transparency.

## How does it work?

Differential Evolution is used several times to achieve the results. Each execution will add a new circle that minimizes the difference between the image we're building and the target one.
