## What's phishing?

Phishing is a cybercrime in which someone poses as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

## Other names for phishing

Other than email and website phishing, there’s also 'vishing' (voice phishing), 'smishing' (SMS Phishing) and several other phishing techniques cybercriminals are constantly coming up with. 

## Common Features of Phishing Emails

- Too Good To Be True

- Sense of Urgency

- Hyperlinks

- Attachments

## How to protect against phishing

To protect against spam mails, spam filters can be used.

The browser settings should be changed to prevent fraudulent websites from opening. Browsers keep a list of fake websites.

Many websites require users to enter login information while the user image is displayed. It’s also a good idea for websites to use a CAPTCHA system for added security.

Banks and financial organizations use monitoring systems to prevent phishing. 

If there is a link in an email, hover over the URL first. Secure websites with a valid Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate begin with “https”. Eventually all sites will be required to have a valid SSL.

## Interesting fact

The first phishing lawsuit was filed in 2004 against a Californian teenager who created the imitation of the website “America Online”. With this fake website, he was able to gain sensitive information from users and access the credit card details to withdraw money from their accounts.
