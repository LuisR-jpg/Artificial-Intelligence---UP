--- LINUX ---
For console: ctrl + alt + T
C++:
  To compile: g++ nombre.cpp	//Se guarda en a.out
	      g++ nombre.cpp -o salida.out //Se guarda en salida.out
  To run: ./a.out
  To compile and run: g++ nombre.cpp && ./a.out
		      g++ nombre.cpp -o nombre.out && ./nombre.out

--- NVIM ---
To exit: esc, esc, :, q   //Sometimes needed !q
To enter a file: nvim nombre.ext
ctrl + n: Autocomplete, in insert mode
To move:
	It's possible to use numbers, like 3l, 4w, 7b
	l: right
	h: left
	j: down
	k: up
	w: takes the cursor to the beginning of the next word
	b: beginning of previous word
	e: ending of the word
To insert:
	i: inserts in the last char
	a: to insert after the char
	A: to insert at the end of the line
	o: Inserts in a new line below cursor's line
	O: Inserts in a new line above the cursor's line
	ctrl + O: Goes to normal mode waiting for an action
To remove: 
	x: Being in normal mode deletes next char (like supr)
	d, $: Deletes from the cursor to the end of line
	d, d: Deletes the whole line
	d works with movement operators:
		d, w: Deletes from the cursor to beginning of next word
		d, e: From cursor to ending of word
		d, b: From cursor to beginning of previous word
	It's possible to multiply the operator
		d, 6, w: It's like pressing dw 6 times
		d, 2, d: Takes 2 lines
To save:
	:, w  //Saves
	:, wq //Saves and exits 
To move between files:
	If the cursor is placed over a call:
		g + d //Takes you to definition in the file
		g + f //Takes to the selected file
		Navegation stacks.
		T o come back in the history: ctrl + o
		To go forward again: ctrl + i
Undo, redo:
	u: undo
	ctrl + r: redo
Clipboard:
	Deleting doesn't exist, it's just cutting
	p: Pastes the line after the cursor
	P: Pastes before the cursor
	To copy and paste:
		v: Enters the visual mode (selects every place it goes)
			x: To delete selection
			y: Exits the mode, but the selection is in the clipboard 
		:%y //Copies everything
		:%x //Cuts everything
To replace: 
	If you mistyped one character:
		r: Over the wrong letter and just write the correct one
	In case you mistyped more letters:
		R: Overwrites from the cursor
	:s/original/newWord	//Replaces first ocurrence of line
	:s/original/newWord/g	//Replaces all ocurrences in line
	:s/original/newWord/gc 	//Asks for every change
	:%s/original/newWord/g	//Replaces in the whole document
	:%s/original/newWord/gc	//Replaces in the whole document, asking
To change:
	cw: Deletes from cursor to end of word and enables to insert
	ciw: Deletes the whole word, no matter where the cursor is
To jump:
	g, g: Takes to beginning of file
	G: Takes to end of file
	(numero)G: Takes to the line of number (numero)
	%: To go from extreme parenthesis or takes you to the next parenthesis 
	0: Starting of line
	$: End of line
To search: 
	/(buscaralgo): Starts to look from the cursor
	?(buscaralgo): Starts searching backwards from the cursor
	After looking for something:
		Press enter and then: 
		n: To see for next matches
		N: For previous matches 
			The direction depends of the operator (/ o ?)

Tricks:
	d, d, p: Swaps two lines
