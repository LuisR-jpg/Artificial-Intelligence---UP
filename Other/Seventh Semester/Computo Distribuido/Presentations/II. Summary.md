## Servers 

**What's a server**

A server is a high-performance computer, designed to perform other tasks.

Servers work with a specialized operating system and are bulit to support various users.

They are designed to operate large-scale applications.

**Classification of servers**

- Stateful servers. Record information of the requests.

- Stateless servers. Doesn't store anything.

- Concurrent servers. Serve several users at the same time.

**Server infrastructure**

- Tower servers.

It's similar to a common desktop. 

- Rack servers. 

It's a model that has expansion slots, aka Mezzanine slots.

It's possible to connect them to external storage.

They require more cooling than the tower servers.

- Blade servers.

These servers are shaped like small boxes and projected into modules, allowing more servers to be accommodated in a smaller space.

Unlike Rack servers, Blade servers:

    - Multiple blade servers can operate in a chassis.

    - Network components, such as ethernet switches, firewalls and load balancers within the same server enclosure.

    - It uses less power per server because power and cooling are shared.

## Cloud
**Cloud services**

Types:

- SAAS. Software as a service.

- PAAS. Platform as a service.

- IAAS. Infrastructure as a service.

- PAAS + SAAS. Cloud computing.

**Cloud computing**

Using cloud computing is a good alternative.

- Doesn't require a large investment.

- Needs a smaller IT team.

- No concerns about outdated software or hardware.

- No internet, no access.


## Virtualization

Using a virtual computers offers some benefits like flexibility.

Also, it has a program called hypervisor that places a layer between the OS and hardware, thus, a single computer can handle several VMs.

## Data center or Data processing center

**What's a data center**

Nervous system of the companies.

It's a space designed for concentrating servers, data processing, storage equipment and network asset systems.

**Types of data centers**

Tier I.

99.671% of availability.

- The service can be interrupted without notice.

- No redundancy.

- No cooling system.

Tier II.

99.741% of availability.

- Redundancy systems.

- Auxiliary power generators.

- Elevated floors. 

- It can still have unforeseen interruptions.

Tier III.

99.98% of availability.

- No affected by unscheduled outages.

- Only stops for maintenance.

Tier IV.

99.995% of availability.

- Stops only 26 minutes throughout the year.

- High level of redundancy.

- High efficiency cooling systems.

- Alternative power supply systems.

## Storage

Enabling hard disks on a local network.

**Types**

- DAS 

- NAS 

- SAN

## Distributed computing

**What is distributed computing?**

Distributed computing is a system of software components spread over different computers but running as a single entity.

**Architecture of distributed systems**

The backbone is a complex network of server that anyone can join.

Components and connectors arrange themselves in a way that eases communication.

It's broadly divided into two essential concepts:

- Software architecture.

    It's the logical organization of software components.

    The main architectures are:

        - Layered architecture.

        - Object-based architecture.

        - Data-centered architecture. 

- System architecture

    Focuses on the entire system and the placement of components of a distributed system accross multiple machines. 

    The main system architectures are:

        - Client-server architecture.
            Central security.

        - Peer-to-peer architecture
            No central control in a distributed system. 
            They have 3 separate sections:
