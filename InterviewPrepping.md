### For my interviewers

- What’s been your most memorable experience here and why?

- What’s one thing you’re hoping to get from an intern? How can an intern make your life easier?

### Behavioral
- Why would you like to work in this company? 

    - Microsoft
        
        I have had the opportunity to see what it's like to work in Microsoft and I would say it's a work culture that fits mine. I'm also looking forward to work on something I like and use on a daily basis like the microsoft products:
            
        - Visual studio code
        - Microsoft office
        - Windows (most of the time)
        - Microsoft edge
        - Xbox
        - Outlook 

- Favorite product of the company

    - Microsoft 

        Microsoft Office is undoubtedly the set of applications that I'm the most comfortable with. I've been open to try different suites but in terms of speed, hours of use and comfort, MS Office is the one to go.

- Hard situation of previous jobs

    - Language barrier

        As a non native English speaker, I faced myself the imposter's syndrome not because of my technical skills but because of my English level. The level was not a problem actually, but there was still a mental block that (even though it didn't interfere with my job), there was this persistent thought of not knowing if I'm making a good use of the language. 
        How I approached this problem was by trying to lose the fear and started to practice the areas that I felt I could improve on, also, I enrolled back to English classes to work on my skills and self-confidence.

    - Documentation

        Reading documentation is a day-to-day activity that I had to face as a software engineering intern that I wasn't aware of. But after I realised how important this is, I improved on my research skills within the documentation and even after the job, I started looking for answers in the documentation when possible and leaving forums and tutorials as an extra resource.

    - Questions

        People stressed so much the part of making questions and still it took me some time to realise the importance of making the right questions at the right time. Once I learned that, I was able to ease my work.

### Technical

- Thread vs Process

- Explain recursion as if you were telling a kid.
