#### Summary

##### Proposed algorithm

Simplified version of Projected Gradient Descent, a deterministic and iterative algorithm based on the gradient vector direction. The optimization problem is multi-objective with bound constraints (also known as box constraints).



#### Terms to investigate

- Pareto front

- Natural coordinates or fully cartesian coordinates

- Firefly algorithm (is it differential evolution?)
