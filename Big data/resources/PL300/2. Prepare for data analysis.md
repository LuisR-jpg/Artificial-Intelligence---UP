# Prepare for data analysis

## Get data in Power BI

### Get data from files

#### Flat file

- One data table

- Every row is in the same structure

- Doesn't contain hierarchies

- Common types are: `csv`, `txt`, `xlsx`

#### Connect to data in a file

<kbd>Home</kbd> -> <kbd>Get data</kbd>

#### Change the source file

Useful to keep your report up-to-date even when the file location has changed:

1. <kbd>Home</kbd>

2. <kbd>Data source settings</kbd>

3. <kbd>Change source</kbd>

4. Update the field <kbd>File path</kbd>
